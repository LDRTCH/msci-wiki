Welcome to the cp branch activity log repository!

The finalised files for each week are determined by the syntax "week*.qmd" (where * represents the specific week). These are then published through quarto into html files, and accessible online at this link: https://ldrtch.github.io/msci-wiki/activity_log/landing.html

There are also standard markdown files, going by the syntax "week*.md". They should usually match pretty well with their .qmd counterparts, but they should be taken as last drafts, rather than the final version. This is due to the editing process I use: I write most of the week files in markdown (leveraging a gedit plugin that gives me an instant preview of the interpreted file, but that only works with .md files), then create a .qmd copy which can be interpreted by Quarto. At this stage the .qmd and .md versions are the same. I then add finishing touches to the .qmd copy, after seeing how the display appears within the Quarto website (that I visualise beforehand with "quarto preview <filename>"; this opens an external browser that is more difficult to work with, but useful for last minute interventions).

TL;DR: Read the .qmd versions if you need direct access to the text! Treat the .md versions as rough backups.

EDIT: after some post-project revising in preparation for one-pdf rendering, having the Markdown files in the same folders proved disastrous for rendering tthe final documents. This, alongside format changes making the Markdown files outdated resulted in the decision to delete the markdown files altogether. No information was lost since all the edits are stored in the github page anyway.

Example: colloidal particles\n\nsolvent containing H2O2\ncoat one hemisphere in catalyst for H2O2\nresulting local concentration leads to individual particle propulsion along symmetry axis\n\naxis undergoes rotational diffusion due to fluctuation\n\nsingle-particle trajectories with a persistence length analogous to polymers(?)\n\n\n\nActive Brownian Particles (ABPs)\n\npersistent motion\nparticle interactions\n\nshort range\ntypically repulsive\n\nparticles aggregate into clusters (even without cohesive forces)\n\ndynamic feedback between speed and density: motility-induced phase separation (MIPS)\n\n\n\n\nBacteria biofilms constitute development into multicellular communities through aggregation; exhibit novel properties:\n\ndifferentiation\ndelegation of function\n\nFree bacteria, upon interacting with surfaces, adapt to the new conditions by adopting different motility modes\n\nby contrast, biofilms can nucleate when a number of bacteria settle down near a surface and become completely localised\n\nnucleation: first step in formation of a new thermodynamic phase or structure via self-assembly/self-organisation within a substance or mixture"

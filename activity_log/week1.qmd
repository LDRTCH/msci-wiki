# Week 1 Goals
The main goal of week 1 is to get an introductory grasp of the literature regarding active matter.
The secondary goal of week 2 is to set up a communication method for sharing files and information easily throughout this project.

Taking information from the following articles:

<h2> I. The 2020 motile active roadmap, Gompper et al. </h2>
	
<h4>a. Introduction, Gompper & Roland </h4>

Active matter is a class of nonequilibrium systems composed of a large number of autonomous agents

- persistently out of equilibrium (constituents continuously consume energy)

	- absence of equilibrium concepts

		- detailed balance

		- Gibbs ensemble & free energy

		- time-reversal symmetry

- therefore theories must be constructed on:

	- symmetries:

		- polar shape (regarding polarity of molecules)

		- nematic shape (regarding molecules that are aligned loosely parallel)

		- interactions of agents

	- conservation laws

	- dynamic rules

- examples are agent-based standard models

	- <b>active Brownian particles</b>

	- squirmers
	(complemented by continuum field theory)

- aim is creation of artificial active matter (synthetic micro/nanomachines)

	- look to biological active matter

		- propulsion mechanisms (rotation, translation and periodic altering of shape)

			- cilia

			- flagella

		- navigation strategies

			- chemotaxis: movement/orientation along chemical concentration gradient (toward or away from stimulus)

			- phototaxis: movement/orientation towards or away from light

		(what is the scale lower limit of such behaviour?)

	- as such, suggested synthetic micro/nanomachines can utilise:

		- phoresis

			- diffusiophoresis: motion of species A in response to concentration gradient in colloidal species B

			- thermophoresis: motion in mixture of particles along temperature gradient (tendency of light molecules to hot and heavy particles to cold)

- swarming: spontaneous self-organisation of active agents in large numbers -> emergent coordinated collective motion on various length scales

	- determined by

		- agent shape

		- steric interactions

		- sensing

		- fluctuations

		- environmentally-mediated interactions

		novel phenomena:

		- motility-induced phase separation

		- active turbulence

<h4>b. Active Brownian particles: from collective phenomena to fundamental physics, Speck</h4>

Active matter makes use of "persistence of motion"; locally broken symmetry, rather than a global preferred direction.

Synthetic active matter employs particle shape, ultrasound, etc. to facilitate movement.

**Janus particles** as important experimental strategy of locomotion: two hemispheres with different surface properties. Example: **colloidal particles**

- solvent containing H2O2

- coat one hemisphere in catalyst for H2O2

- resulting local concentration leads to individual particle propulsion along symmetry axis
	
	- axis undergoes rotational diffusion due to fluctuation
	
		- single-particle trajectories with a *persistence length* analogous to polymers(?)
		
**Active Brownian Particles (ABPs)**

- persistent motion

- particle interactions

	- short range
	
	- typically repulsive
	
- particles aggregate into clusters (even without cohesive forces)

	- dynamic feedback between speed and density: motility-induced phase separation (MIPS)
	
## II. Run-and-tumble dynamics in a crowded environment: Persistent exclusion process for swimmers, Soto & Golestanian

Bacteria biofilms constitute development into multicellular communities through aggregation; exhibit novel properties:

- differentiation
	
- delegation of function
	
Free bacteria, upon interacting with surfaces, adapt to the new conditions by adopting different motility modes

- by contrast, biofilms can **nucleate** when a number of bacteria settle down near a surface and become <b>completely localised</b>
		
	- [nucleation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation): first step in formation of a new thermodynamic phase or structure via self-assembly/self-organisation within a substance or mixture

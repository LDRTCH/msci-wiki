# 1. Introduction

This is the landing spot for work on the Motivational Report. It was initially prompted in Week 2 as a way to get familiarised with the literature; it is expected to be a considerable part of the Interim Report, whose [deadline](./../shared/deadlines.qmd) is in Week 9.

Active matter is, broadly, a subcategory of matter systems distingushed primarily by energy input homogenously distributed across all constituents (agents) of the system, which in turn set their own self-propelled motion across a force-free medium (for instance, the forces between particles and the fluid they move through cancel)[1]. The agents therefore have direct access to energy, and use it to autonomously propel and direct themselves (with different models and situations allowing for various degrees of freedom). The study of active matter is generally grounded in (but not limited to) observed behaviour of biological agents, as they are the primary (though not only) examples of active matter in nature.

The evident motivation in studying active matter is that it helps understand biological behaviours, and therefore the natural world. Macroscopically, the construction of theoretical models can help explain, and to a limited degree predict, the behaviour of animals (such as locusts) undergoing collectively-emergent swarming behaviours (where each animal can be treated as its own autonomous agent, sharing the same generally stable ‘rules’ of altering speed and orientation while interacting with each other and the environment)[2]. This is not limited to what can be termed ‘simple’ behaviour; human behaviour can be partially mapped and understood within physically-indexed accounts of autonomous choices within (overtly or suggestively) constrained collective action. Interesting examples are swarming behaviours identified in traffic, crowd disasters and concerts[3] (note however that physical models are sometimes challenged in literature due to potential oversimplifications, insofar as, for instance, cognitive heuristics under duress might deal holistically, rather than individually, with other human agents[4]). Microscopically, active matter models offer insight into understanding how hierarchically-organised emergence happens within cell tissues, and how it may be leveraged by medicine[5].

Outside of biology, active matter research serves to emulate, or otherwise learn from, naturally-occurring behaviours in order to analyse a potentially more general thermodynamic state. Due to the necessarily dissipative use of energy within self-organised agents, and their internally-induced behaviour, active matter is not described by the statistical mechanics of equilibrium states. The question then arises whether, through quantitative computation and qualitative modelling/theorising, the thermodynamic laws of equilibria can be modified and generalised to non-equilibrium states, and how these generalisations hold as departure from equilibrium through various means is increased[6]. These generalisations would, ideally, collapse into the known statistical thermodynamics states within the equilibrium limit. These insights, in turn, would facilitate the creation of synthetic active matter, whose potential, although speculatory, ranges from the biomedical application of nanomachine targeted drug delivery possibilities to the location-mapping application of nanoscopic/microscopic enivronmental sensing[7].

The feature in active matter of converting stored and homogenously available energy, such as chemical potential, into mechanical work is also of great importance to the field: understanding how this can work and how to facilitate, among other things, long-term energy access across the active matter substance is a key pursuit of nanotechnology[8]. Statistical and computational models can lend insight into individual and collective dynamics, and in turn give way to new experimental designs of nano/micromechanical systems.

Active matter is, broadly, a subcategory of matter systems [FT "matter systems is unclear]() distingushed primarily by energy input homogenously distributed across all constituents (agents) of the system, which in turn set their own self-propelled motion across a force-free medium (for instance, the forces between particles and the fluid they move through cancel [FT not exactly. Theres i no mechanical equilibrium. On the contrary, there is dissipation]() )[1]. The agents therefore have *direct* access to energy, and use it to autonomously propel and direct themselves (with different models and situations allowing for various degrees of freedom). The study of active matter is generally grounded in (but not limited to) observed behaviour of biological agents, as they are the primary (though not only) examples of active matter in nature. [FT very good]()

The evident motivation in studying active matter is that it helps understand biological behaviours, and therefore the natural world [FT be more precise: it is the world of living organisms, which constantly dissipate energy to perform their biological functions](). Macroscopically, the construction of theoretical models can help explain, and to a limited degree predict, the behaviour of animals (such as locusts) undergoing collectively-emergent swarming behaviours (where each animal can be treated as its own autonomous agent, sharing the same generally stable 'rules' of altering speed and orientation while interacting with each other and the environment)[2]. This is not limited to what can be termed 'simple' behaviour; human behaviour can be partially mapped and understood within physically-indexed accounts of autonomous choices within (overtly or suggestively) constrained collective action. [FT: You are onto something here. Physicist Andrea Cavagna likes to say that *"Physics gauges the surprise in biology"*  ]()Interesting examples are swarming behaviours identified in traffic, crowd disasters and concerts[3] (note however that physical models are sometimes challenged in literature due to potential oversimplifications, insofar as, for instance, cognitive heuristics under duress might deal holistically, rather than individually, with other human agents[4]  [FT not clear to me, please explain]() ).  Microscopically, active matter models offer insight into understanding how hierarchically-organised emergence happens within cell tissues, and how it may be leveraged by the medical sciences[5].

Outside of biology, active matter research serves to emulate, or otherwise learn from naturally-occurring behaviours in order to analyse a potentially more general thermodynamic state [FT "state" is not a good word. Are you thinking about a more general thermodynamic framework?]() . Due to the necessarily dissipative use of energy within self-organised agents, and their internally-induced behaviour, active matter is not described by the statistical mechanics of equilibrium states. The question then arises whether, through quantitative computation and qualitative modelling/theorising, the thermodynamic laws of equilibrium can be modified and generalised to non-equilibrium states, and how these generalisations hold as departure from equilibrium through various means is increased[6] [FT: not easy to read, but the idea is important: we can be just slight off equilibrium, and have a so-called linear-response regime, or we could be beyond linear response]() . These generalisations would, ideally, collapse into the known statistical thermodynamics states within the equilibrium limit. These insights, in turn, would facilitate the creation of synthetic active matter, whose potential, although speculatory, ranges from the biomedical application of nanomachine targeted drug delivery possibilities to the location-mapping application of nanoscopic/microscopic enivronmental sensing[7]. 

The feature in active matter of converting stored and homogenously available energy, such as chemical potential, into mechanical work is also of great importance to the field: understanding how this can work and how to facilitate, among other things, long-term energy access across the active matter substance is a key pursuit of nanotechnology[8]. Statistical and computational models can lend insight into individual and collective dynamics, and in turn give way to new experimental designs of nano/micromechanical systems. 

[FT: You could get into more specifics, illustrating some examples of interesting behaviorus such as pattern formation or phase separation]()

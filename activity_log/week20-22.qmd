# 1. Introduction

The aims of these last few weeks is to finish up experimental analysis, revise some mistakes in previous weeks, as well as prepare figures for the final report. These Weeks will also contain all the final results of analysis that were previously not fully included in the activity log (due to preliminary individual work which was shared at the end between lab partners). 

# 2. Cluster Periodicity

This is an improved version of `cluster-analysis.py`, which can be found in the `src` folder. It uses a newer function which separates clusters while keeping boundary periodicity. The jupyter notebook can be found in `notebooks/cp_cluster_analysis.ipynb`, or by clicking [here](./../notebooks/cp_cluster_analysis.ipynb).

# 9. Interpolation

The code for interpolation is widely the same as the one in Section 8. As such, it is not pasted here or linked on the website (but can be found in `notebooks/cp_interpolation.ipynb`). Below are the results with arbitrarily assigned tumbling rates *between* the 10 values we have been using throughout this project.

## Interpolation Predictions on Other Data Types

# 10. Extrapolation

Likewise, the code for extrapolation is widely the same as the one in Section 8  (and can be found in `notebooks/cp_extrapolation.ipynb`). The results are plotted below, for both high-bounds extrapolation case (above the 10 training tumbling rates) and low-bounds extrapolation case (below the 10 training tumbling rates).

# 11. Autocorrelation Improvement

We have made improvements to the autocorrelation function. The full code can be found [here](./../notebooks/acf.ipynb). 

We can now visualise the decorrelation from $\rho$ to $\rho^2$, how different turning rates decorrelate, as well as how the acf functions for rolled vs unrolled data under normalised lag domains (accounting for four-rolling's x4 increased dataset).

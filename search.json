Introduction\nThe goal of week 2 is to further familiarise ourselves with the literature. We are to write a quick 500-word referenced report detailing motivations for studying active matter. Notes for this week will therefore be slightly sparser, primarily sifting through the goals of various papers (their detailed processes are to be examined at a later date). Some of these tidbits of information will be taken from the texts explored in week 1; as such, overlap with week 1 information is not only possible, but very likely. Repetition was preferred over disorganised and uncatalogued information, as these notes serve both as an activity log (which must document repeats occasionally) and as a catalogue of information as it is found.\nAnother essential goal of weeks 1 and 2 was to figure out the general examination schedule of the project. This in turn would influence planning the project out more properly, in anticipation of the deadline for the interrim report (other influences, naturally, are personal academic schedules; I personally anticipate being much busier during the first term, and therefore expect higher activity during the latter half of the project). This schedule was not given out to the 30cp version of the project page until very recently, and has therefore been appended in the activity log for this week.\nAbove is a table of contents. Below is a list of a few of the utilised texts, with some key information extracted. The 500-word referenced essay is given afterwards. At the very bottom is a very brief introduction to the Langevin equation. On an informational level, this is meant as a way to ease in into Brownian motion theory; on a technical level, this also gives a brief occasion to experiment with LaTex in markdown.\n\n\n2. Deadline Schedule\n\nWeek 1: Start of project\nWeek 9: Optional interim report submitted. Formative only. Deadline is Thursday 23rd November @ 12.30pm.\nWeek 19: Practical work (experimental or computational/theoretical) must finish by the end of the week. Friday 8th March.\nWeeks 20/21: Analysis of results obtained. Start write up of report. Results to be presented to supervisor and analysis discussed.\nWeek 22: Final Report submission. Deadline is Thursday 18th April @ 12.30pm.\nWeeks 23/24: Final interviews with Assessors and supervisors. Assessment: The final assessment is worth 100% of the total marks available.\n\n(This schedule will be added on the website as a separate tab as well.)\n\n\n3. Text information\n\nThe Mechanics and Statistics of Active Matter\nThis is a 2010 review of (at the time) recent progress within the field. Its main role for my current purposes is to obtain references to older papers (and therefore to their motivations), while also providing a starting definition for active matter.\n\nactive matter can be considered as a type of material\ntake active matter as condensed matter in a nonequilibrium regime\n\neach (autonomous/active) constituent takes direct energetic input\n\nenergy input is therefore homogenously distributed in system\ncompare to fluid motion, for instance: energy is not supplied to each individual particle, but rather is applied (e.g. kinetically) at the boundaries: this then causes particles to push others forward, but they don’t all have direct access to energy\nslightly related, Ramaswamy argues in one of his lectures that this is the key distinction of active matter, phrased as direct access to energy (in the fluid example above, the bulk particles have indirect access to energy)\n\nforce-free: forces exerted between particle and fluid cancel\n(self-propelled) motion is set by particle, not external fields\n\n\n\n\nCatalytic Nanomotors: Autonomous Movement of Striped Nanorods, Paxton, Kistler et al.\nThis is a 2004 paper experimentally confirming a solution to the convection-diffusion relation applied to rod-shaped particles (with Pt and Au segments) moving autonomously in hydrogen peroxide solutions.\n\none of the big nanotechnology challenges is the conversion of stored chemical technology to motion\n\nthis is precisely what many biological active matter systems do\nstudying this would yield useful artifficial active matter systems\n\n\n\n\nActive matter: quantifying the departure from equilibrium, Flenner & Szamel\nThis is a 2020 paper examining active matter systems as they are moved further away from thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nthe main motivational point here is that quantifying departure from equilibrium helps understand the difference between active matter and equilibium systems, and thus can help chart generalised models of how they both work\n\n\n\n\n4. Motivation Report\nActive matter is, broadly, a subcategory of matter systems distingushed primarily by energy input homogenously distributed across all constituents (agents) of the system, which in turn set their own self-propelled motion across a force-free medium (for instance, the forces between particles and the fluid they move through cancel)[1]. The agents therefore have direct access to energy, and use it to autonomously propel and direct themselves (with different models and situations allowing for various degrees of freedom). The study of active matter is generally grounded in (but not limited to) observed behaviour of biological agents, as they are the primary (though not only) examples of active matter in nature.\nThe evident motivation in studying active matter is that it helps understand biological behaviours, and therefore the natural world. Macroscopically, the construction of theoretical models can help explain, and to a limited degree predict, the behaviour of animals (such as locusts) undergoing collectively-emergent swarming behaviours (where each animal can be treated as its own autonomous agent, sharing the same generally stable ‘rules’ of altering speed and orientation while interacting with each other and the environment)[2]. This is not limited to what can be termed ‘simple’ behaviour; human behaviour can be partially mapped and understood within physically-indexed accounts of autonomous choices within (overtly or suggestively) constrained collective action. Interesting examples are swarming behaviours identified in traffic, crowd disasters and concerts[3] (note however that physical models are sometimes challenged in literature due to potential oversimplifications, insofar as, for instance, cognitive heuristics under duress might deal holistically, rather than individually, with other human agents[4]). Microscopically, active matter models offer insight into understanding how hierarchically-organised emergence happens within cell tissues, and how it may be leveraged by medicine[5].\nOutside of biology, active matter research serves to emulate, or otherwise learn from, naturally-occurring behaviours in order to analyse a potentially more general thermodynamic state. Due to the necessarily dissipative use of energy within self-organised agents, and their internally-induced behaviour, active matter is not described by the statistical mechanics of equilibrium states. The question then arises whether, through quantitative computation and qualitative modelling/theorising, the thermodynamic laws of equilibria can be modified and generalised to non-equilibrium states, and how these generalisations hold as departure from equilibrium through various means is increased[6]. These generalisations would, ideally, collapse into the known statistical thermodynamics states within the equilibrium limit. These insights, in turn, would facilitate the creation of synthetic active matter, whose potential, although speculatory, ranges from the biomedical application of nanomachine targeted drug delivery possibilities to the location-mapping application of nanoscopic/microscopic enivronmental sensing[7].\nThe feature in active matter of converting stored and homogenously available energy, such as chemical potential, into mechanical work is also of great importance to the field: understanding how this can work and how to facilitate, among other things, long-term energy access across the active matter substance is a key pursuit of nanotechnology[8]. Statistical and computational models can lend insight into individual and collective dynamics, and in turn give way to new experimental designs of nano/micromechanical systems.\n\n499 words. \n\nReferences\n\nActive matter: quantifying the departure from equilibrium.

Langevin Equation\nThe Langevin equation represents the partly-random particle movement of a particle within a fluid:\n\\[m \\frac{dv}{dt}=-\\lambda \\mathbf{v} +\\boldsymbol{\\eta} (t)\\] where \\(\\textbf{v}\\) is particle velocity, \\(\\lambda\\) is the damping coefficient, m is the particle mass, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\) is the noise term.\nThe noise term indicates collisions of the given particle with other molecules within the fluid. It is determined by a Gaussian distribution, and for the Boltzmann constant \\(k_{B}\\), temperature \\(T\\) and \\(\\eta_{i}\\) being the i-th component of vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}(t)\\), it is described by the following correlation function:\n\\[\\langle \\eta_{i} (t) \\eta_{j} (t')\\rangle = 2 \\lambda k_{B} T \\delta_{i,j} \\delta(t-t')\\]\nThis approximates that any given force (at time \\(t\\)) is uncorrelated with a force at any other time. The collision time with other molecules indicates this is not the case. However, within great collective motion this is broadly the case. The appearance of the damping coefficient \\(\\lambda\\) in the correlation function is, within an equilibrium system, an expression of the Einstein relation.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Goals\nThe main goal of week 1 is to get an introductory grasp of the literature regarding active matter.\nThe secondary goal of week 1 is to set up a communication and recording method for sharing files and information easily throughout this project.\n\n\n2. Communication/Recording Method\nCommunication is done through a github repository. Both myself and my lab partner have personal branches: cp and np respectively. I will try to stick to the convention of referencing my contributions in github commits and code comments as “cp”. We also have a shared branch, where we upload collective work. Per the demands of this assignment, all progress will be documented individually, despite the collaborative nature of the project. There may therefore be repeats between the activity log and various files in the shared branch; wherever possible, the shared folder will be referenced rather than copied (such as the storing of programs and data).\nThere is also the individual gh-pages branch, which hosts a github website which should contain both shared and individual work. This may be the cleanest method of accessing the activity log, though presumably an exported pdf will be required for examination. Nonetheless, I link (embedded) all the relevant pages below:\n\ngithub repository (note that this is private, so it requires an access invite)\nwebsite landing page\n\npersonal activity log\n\n\nThere is also the matter of convention. We have set up weekly supervisor meetings on Thursday. As such, the way weeks are kept track of is slightly unconventional, purely for pragmatic reasons. Week 1, for instance, began on the first Thursday of the university year, and ended on the second Thursday of it. It might therefore seem strange to see major edits in the github repository for, say, the Week 2 activity log on Wednesday night in what would normally be called week 3. I will think of ways to make this easier to keep track of, but the system works for now. There will (hopefully) be an addendum to this paragraph if/when I clarify the record-keeping system.\n\n\n3.

To this end, a suitable environment to work in must be found and utilised. For now we are primarily sticking to python.\nWe have gained access to the Bristol supercomputers BlueCrystal4 and BluePebble (I have access to the former, my lab partner has access to the latter). We will attempt to apply the scripts to the supercomputers.\nIn Week 2 it was suggested that I would go more in depth in statistical analysis. This has been put aside for now, in the interest of getting a feel for how ABP simulations work in practice.\n#2. Configuring BlueCrystal4\nI already have access to BlueCrystal4 (BC4) due to one of my other modules. For that particular module, I am programming in C/C++; as such, I have already configured (installed and loaded) modules compatible with it. These modules are generally installed on a user instance, and loaded using the following bash command: module load &lt;path&gt;. For example, for loading the necessary files for Intel’s C/C++ compiler (icc), I use the following: module load languages/intel/2020-u4.\nThe issue that arises is that, at least initially, we have decided to work in Python. While I plan to attempt to translate (and speed up) our later codes in C, it is preferable to agree on a shared language while we get our bearings (and Python is easier, for all its faults). I therefore need use both C and python modules; hopefully this will not cause conflicts as long as they are not loaded simultaneously. The loading can easily be done in the .bashrc script on the user home instance, which will keep the module loaded for any and all processes. This is inadvised in the BC4 user manual, however - like I said, conflicts can occur. It is much healthier and safer to instead load modules in the .sh script that will send a request to the job queue. This will be elaborated on later.\nYou load/add modules with module load or module add. I have used the former for C and the latter for Python, though strictly to differentiate the two better. Below is a quick list of the different module commands I use:\nmodule avail #Lists available modules; can combine with grep to search for a specific one\n\nmodule load languages/intel/2020-u4 #Loads icc for C/C++\nmodule add languages/anaconda3/2022.11-3.9.13-tensorflow-2.11 #Loads anaconda tensor flow package\nmodule add languages/anaconda3/2020−3.8.5 #Loads full anaconda package\ncurl https://pyenv.run | bash #Loads python environment (non-anaconda alternative)\n\n#NOTE: only one of these should be done for any instance!\n\nmodule list #Lists loaded modules\nTested a quick “Hello, World!” program just to make sure that python runs correctly; it does, at least for now.\n\n3.

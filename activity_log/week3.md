#1. Goals

The main aim of this week is to begin reproducing a simple active matter system in code. To this end, a suitable environment to work in must be found and utilised. For now we are primarily sticking to python.

We have gained access to the Bristol supercomputers BlueCrystal4 and BluePebble (I have access to the former, my lab partner has access to the latter). We will attempt to apply the scripts to the supercomputers.
